Nimble 6
========

Thanks to NOXOiD (https://github.com/deathseeker41) for break testing features

A lightweight tool for managing a server for webhosting. Nimble manages
a webserver and email platform. User management is Linux centric.
Instead of installing an FTP service, SFTP is expected to be used
instead. Email is handled by Postfix and Dovecot. Web services are
delivered with Apache, PHP, and MySQL 5.6.

The general philosophy is to manage the OS, not be it's own OS. The
problem we have with cPanel is that it is pretty much it's own OS and
parallels' Plesk Panel is designed to be multi-platform leaving quality
to be lackluster. This version of Nimble is designed for RHEL 6 and
CentOS 6. We don't support anything more than that. It gives us the
ability to ensure the platform will be stable and work. To reflect the
current platform Nimble support's, the naming convention matches the
platform. This means that Nimble 6 is for RHEL/CentOS 6 and Nimble 7
will be for RHEL/CentOS 7. 

Installation
============
Just run the following command on your server to install Nimble.
# cd / && yum install git -y; git clone https://github.com/Igknighted/nimble.git && /nimble/install
