Usage: Used to swiftly make a modularized website with pretty URLs.

Gettings Started
----------------
All public site scripts belong in the modules directory. There is a default example page
  modules/default/index.php
  modules/default/404.php
  
They are called by default when the homepage is accessed or when the page requested does 
not exist. If we wanted to add a page, we would create a directory and files like so:
  modules/mymod/index.php
  modules/mymod/type_of_action.php

They would be accessed like so from your website:
  http://mysite.com/mymod/
  http://mysite.com/mymod/index
  - These two URLs take us to the module modules/mymod/index.php
  
  http://mysite.com/mymod/type_of_action
  - This takes us to to the module modules/mymod/type_of_action.php


You can also access get data by using the $mod_verbs variable. For example, lets say our
url is http://mysite.com/mymod/type_of_action/page/1/2/3/4

The mod_verbs variable will contain the following:
  array(7) {
    [0]=>
    string(5) "mymod"
    [1]=>
    string(14) "type_of_action"
    [2]=>
    string(4) "page"
    [3]=>
    string(1) "1"
    [4]=>
    string(1) "2"
    [5]=>
    string(1) "3"
    [6]=>
    string(1) "4"
  }



If you ever question the verbs, just use this function that I've packed in
to the global_functions.php script:
  debug_verbs()



Pre and Post Module Setup
=========================
If you need to do things before and after every module, like connecting to a database,
edit them into files:
  lib/premodule_staging.php
  lib/postmodule_staging.php
  

Global Functions
================
  lib/global_functions.php


External Libaries
=================
Put any external libraries in lib and include them in this file if they are always used.
  lib/premodule_staging.php

If the library is not always used, just use require_once in your script right before
attempting to use it. This will reduce memory footprint bulk.


Module Private Stuff
====================
Lets say you want to have private things included in your module. Slap the private stuff
in lib/modules_private and use require_once(BASEPATH.'/lib/modules_private/MODULENAME/whatever.php')


Last Word
=========
I built this simple framework for my projects, so no complaining. That is all.

Thank you.
